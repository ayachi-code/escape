In the game Escape, you are trapped in a randomly generated dungeon. Your goal is to find the key and escape. Beware of the ghosts patrolling the dungeon—either avoid them or defeat them using a sword, which is also randomly spawned throughout the dungeon.

Time is limited: each level has a 20-second countdown. To survive, find the dungeon key and escape as quickly as possible. Keep an eye out for clocks scattered around the dungeon, as each one adds 5 seconds to your timer.

As you progress, the dungeons grow larger, increasing in size every few levels, until reaching the maximum size at depth 17. The game is unforgiving; if you die, you’ll have to start all over from depth 0.

Here is a demo of the first 17 levels of the game. Fun fact, it took me around 15 tries to reach depth 17.
